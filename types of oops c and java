Aspect,C++,Java
Language Type,C++ is a compiled, general-purpose language that supports both OOP and procedural programming.,Java is a purely object-oriented, platform-independent language.
Memory Management,Manual memory management using new and delete.,Automatic garbage collection; no need for explicit delete.
Access Specifiers,Supports private, public, and protected.,Supports private, public, protected, and default (package-private).
Inheritance,Supports multiple inheritance via classes and virtual inheritance.,Only single inheritance is allowed (multiple inheritance via interfaces).
Polymorphism,Polymorphism requires explicitly declaring methods as virtual.,All methods are virtual by default unless marked final or static.
Abstract Classes,Abstract classes can have both pure virtual methods and implemented methods.,Abstract classes must be declared with abstract and can have implemented methods.
Interfaces,Interfaces arenâ€™t a separate construct; can be achieved via abstract classes.,Interfaces are a distinct construct (interface keyword) and support multiple inheritance.
Pointers,C++ supports pointers, allowing low-level memory manipulation.,Java does not support pointers directly (handles memory safely).
Templates vs. Generics,C++ has templates for generic programming, providing compile-time type safety.,Java has generics, which are implemented at runtime with type erasure.
Operator Overloading,C++ supports operator overloading.,Java does not support operator overloading.
Destructor,C++ supports destructors for cleanup (~ClassName()).,Java relies on finalize() (deprecated) and garbage collection.
